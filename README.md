# stopwatch_app
Python code for a simple stopwatch app that is also a reflex-testing game. 


Note: this program is designed to run in the CodeSkulptor online terminal (www.codeskulptor.org) - the module simplegui will not run in base Python, therefore the code will not run as is. However, this module can be downloaded locally here: https://florian-berger.de/en/software/simplegui/

In addition, you should be able to run it using the CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org) browser interface, which is publicly accessible online. The code may need minor modification to run in CodeSkulptor (e.g., 'print' commands), as it is updated to Python 3 syntax while Codeskulptor implements Python 2.
