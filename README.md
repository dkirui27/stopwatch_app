# stopwatch_app
Python code for a simple stopwatch app that is also a reflex-testing game. 


Note: this program is designed to run in the CodeSkulptor online terminal (www.codeskulptor.org) - the module simplegui will not run in base Python, therefore the code will not run as is. However, this module can be downloaded locally here: https://florian-berger.de/en/software/simplegui/

In addition, you should be able to run it using the CodeSkulptor (www.codeskulptor.org) browser interface, which is publicly accessible online.
